# Guess the Number Game

## Introduction
**Guess the Number** is a simple yet fun browser-based game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player is given 10 chances to guess a randomly generated number within a fixed range (typically 1 to 100). After each guess, the game provides hints such as “Too high” or “Too low” to guide the player toward the correct number. The game ends when the player guesses correctly or exhausts all attempts.
